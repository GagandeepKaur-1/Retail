# Retail-	Retail : The data set was related with retail domain and challenge was to predict whether a store should get opened or not based on certain factors such as sales, population,area etc. Two datasets were given -  store_train.csv and store_test.csv . Data store_train was used to build predictive model for response variable ‘store’. store_test data contained all other factors except ‘store’.Prediction had to be made using the model developed and submission was to be made in a csv files.
 Solution: Algorithm randomForest was used from the library randomForest to make the model and then make predictions. Auc scores were the evaluation criteria. Scored more than the required auc score. The submission was evaluated and correct predictions were made.
